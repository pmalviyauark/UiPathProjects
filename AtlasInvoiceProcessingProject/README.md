### REFrameWork Template ###
**Robotic Enterprise Framework**

* Built on top of *Transactional Business Process* template
* Uses *State Machine* layout for the phases of automation project
* Offers high level logging, exception handling and recovery
* Keeps external settings in *Config.xlsx* file and Orchestrator assets
* Pulls credentials from Orchestrator assets and *Windows Credential Manager*
* Gets transaction data from Orchestrator queue and updates back status
* Takes screenshots in case of system exceptions


### How It Works ###

1. **INITIALIZE PROCESS**
 + ./Framework/*InitiAllSettings* - Load configuration data from Config.xlsx file and from assets
 + ./Framework/*GetAppCredential* - Retrieve credentials from Orchestrator assets or local Windows Credential Manager
 + ./Framework/*InitiAllApplications* - Open and login to applications used throughout the process

2. **GET TRANSACTION DATA**
 + ./Framework/*GetTransactionData* - Fetches transactions from an Orchestrator queue defined by Config("OrchestratorQueueName") or any other configured data source

3. **PROCESS TRANSACTION**
 + *Process* - Process trasaction and invoke other workflows related to the process being automated 
 + ./Framework/*SetTransactionStatus* - Updates the status of the processed transaction (Orchestrator transactions by default): Success, Business Rule Exception or System Exception

4. **END PROCESS**
 + ./Framework/*CloseAllApplications* - Logs out and closes applications used throughout the process
